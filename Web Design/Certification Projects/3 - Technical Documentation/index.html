            <p>An else statement can be combined with an if statement. An else statement contains the block of code that
                executes if
                the conditional expression in the if statement resolves to 0 or a FALSE value.</p>
            <p>The else statement is an optional statement and there could be at most only one else statement following
                if.</p>
            <p>The syntax of the if...else statement is âˆ’</p>
            <p>Here is the syntax for the things you'll use here:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>if</li>
                <li>else</li>
                <li>elif (equivalent to else if)</li>
            </ul>
            <code>if expression: // statement(s) 
                else: // statement(s)</code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="loops">
            <header>Loops</header>
            <p>In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first,
                followed by
                the second, and so on. There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number
                of times.
            </p>
            <p>Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.
            </p>

                There are actually a bunch of different types of loops in Python here they are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>While Loops</li>
                <li>For Loops</li>
                <li>Nested Loops</li>
            </ul>
            <code>for thing in iterable: //
                statements 
            </code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="functions">
            <header>Functions</header>
            <p>A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action.
                Functions provide
                better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.</p>
            <p>As you already know, Python gives you many built-in functions like print(), etc. but you can also create
                your own
                functions. These functions are called user-defined functions.</p>
            <code>print(something)</code>

            <p>Python has been an object-oriented language since it existed. Because of this, creating and using classes
                and objects
                are downright easy. This chapter helps you become an expert in using Python's object-oriented
                programming support.
            </p>
            <p>If you do not have any previous experience with object-oriented (OO) programming, you may want to consult
                an
                introductory course on it or at least a tutorial of some sort so that you have a grasp of the basic
                concepts.</p>
            <code>class SomeClass(): //
                    def __init__(self): //
                        constructor stuff //
            </code>

        <section class="main-section" id="dictionaries">
            <header>Dictionaries</header>
            <p>Each key is separated from its value by a colon (:), the items are separated by commas, and the whole
                thing is
                enclosed in curly braces. An empty dictionary without any items is written with just two curly braces,
                like this:
                {}.</p>
            <p>Keys are unique within a dictionary while values may not be. The values of a dictionary can be of any
                type, but the
                keys must be of an immutable data type such as strings, numbers, or tuples.</p>
